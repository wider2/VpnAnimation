Nightmare of Gif animation with help of Glide 4.61 library

Idea is to show different animations each after other in 1 ImageView

without blinking effect

with cached source

and frame count of each gif file to show 1 iteraction without loop

depends on state and duration

P.S. Real gif files removed from github due to privacy policy of the project.
